# Blog Images

Place your blog post images in this folder structure:

```
public/images/posts/
  └── [post-slug]/
      └── image-name.png
```

Then reference them in markdown:
```markdown
![Description](/images/posts/[post-slug]/image-name.png)
```

Example for "hello-world" post:
```markdown
![Architecture diagram](/images/posts/hello-world/2-paths.png)
```
